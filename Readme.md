 Built with love and help from ChatGPT 

 This is a quick project I built to make DSA feel effortless for learners.

 I had the idea, the DSA knowledge, and the vision — but I’m still learning GUI dev, so I used ChatGPT to help with the Tkinter part.
 If you notice any mistakes or want to contribute you are free to looking forward to work Thanks.

 My long-term goal is to build a complete platform that explains the math, theory, and practical aspects of DSA in a student-friendly way.
